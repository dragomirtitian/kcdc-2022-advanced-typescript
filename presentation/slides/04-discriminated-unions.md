    * A union of literal types
    * It is a union type containing at least one literal type

### Type Guards - Narrowing unions

- Syntactic constructs that help us narrow a union
- To narrow the `value` variable:
    - `'property' in value`  - the `in` type guard
    - `typeof value === 'valid type'` - the `typeof` type guard
    - `value === constant`, `value !== constant`, `!value`, `value` expressions in `if` statements
    - `switch(value)` statements

### Type Guards - Narrowing discriminated unions

* To narrow the `obj` value that is discriminated by `type`:
    * `obj.type === constant`, `obj.type !== constant`, `!obj.type`, `obj.type` expressions in `if` statements
    * `switch(obj.type)` statements
