### What are branded types?

* A primitive type intersected with an object
* The object type that ensures that the resulting type is no longer compatible with the primitive type
    * Can be done with a string literal property
    * Can be done with a unique symbol

---

### Other Applications

* Generally enforce constraints on primitive types that can be traced in the type system
    * A `number` is a database id
    * A `string` is a GUID
